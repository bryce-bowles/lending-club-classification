Built a logistic regression model and a classification tree model for predicting the final status of a loan based on various variables available. Confusion matrix and misclassification rate for each model for a test dataset. Variables that appear to be important for predicting outcome. Plotted and described the ROC curves and AUC for the four models. ([Report](6_Assignment4.pdf))
